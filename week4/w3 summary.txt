Presentation

A fundamental understanding of the key technologies 

LLMs: What are they 
      How they work 
      their capabilities , understanding and generation 

Aws EKS: Introduction ,
	 role in container orchestrisation 
	 why it is suituable for deploying llms

AWS services:
	S3  Lambda , Cloud Watch , I amd and how they will interact with llms

AWS BOTO3:
	Undertaind how to programmatically interact with AWS services using python SDK




LLMS:-
	GPT- generative pretrained Transformer
	
	Used for generating sequences - based on pre trained data
	
	First transformer - build by google for google translate 
	
	
	Transformer: 
		1. Encoding phase - generate and assigns tokesn - Tokenization - https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/
		2. Vector Embedding: numerical repseantation of data  used for capturing semantic relations 
		3. positional Encoding: The dog chased cat or The cat chased dog 
		4. 
		
		
		RNN encode each serially - one sequence at a time 
		The RIver Bank vs The ICICI Bank there is NO context in RNN
		
		Slef attenttion: 
			These are allowd to change vector embeddings - connection between vectors are allowed 
			
			this is single headed 
			
		Multi Head:
			
			INcreasing contextual understanding using multiple heads 
			
		Normalization layer: does the same steps again again with each steps evething will be refined 
		
		Training:
			HI how are you - given to encoder 
			goes to decoder <start> 
			you have the answer - i am well calcualte loss and do back propogation 
			
		INferencing
			HI how are you 
			you get I 
			you reperat again am 
			you repeat again with hi how are you i am you get fine
